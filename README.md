## Overview

NΔT (Next-Advanced-Notation) is a **next-generation data serialization format** designed for **maximum token efficiency**. It compresses JSON and Toon data by mapping keys and values to numeric codes and compact structures, reducing up to **75% of tokens** compared to traditional JSON.

NΔT is perfect for:

- LLM applications (ChatGPT, GPT-4/5)  
- AI workflows with token-limited APIs  
- High-volume data pipelines  
- Developers and researchers needing compact, human-readable data formats

---
